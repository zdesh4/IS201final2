    <div><p> Lets take a look at what has happened to tech industries in the past three years:</p>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li class="resumelistheading">2020
                <ul>
                    <li> Leading up to and during 2020, tech industries revenues and employees were rising at a steady rate</li>
                    <li> Then COVID-19 hit and the world as we know it changed and people were now just sitting at home being online a lot more than they used to be</li>
                    <li> To keep up with the demand that was suddenly being placed on tech companies, these companies had to hire a lot of employees</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="resumelistheading">2021
                <ul>
                    <li> In 2021, these companies revenues skyrocketed, but so did their employee count</li>
                    <li> Amazon is a good example of this because of their 2-day shipping promise, and with a lot more orders coming through that became really hard so they had to hire mnore employees to help with the demand</li>
                    <li> Many CEOs thought that the companies revenue and employee count were going to keep rising in 2022, but that is not what happened</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="resumelistheading">2022
                <ul>
                    <li> In 2022, the trend made it seem like these companies were going to make a lot of revenue, so tech companies continued investing in more and more employees</li>
                    <li> Some of the push behind getting more employees was the talent war, which was when companies were in competition with each other to get the best employees</li>
                    <li> However the exact opposite of what they were expecting happened. Tech companies revenues stalled and some even declined</li>
                    <li> Due to this negative trend in revenues that CEOs did not foresee, these companies had to layoff thousands of employees because they just weren't making the revenue they needed to keep the employees on</li>
                </ul> 
    
            </li>
        </ol>
